summary: Hello, I'm a new hire at Jarvis Consulting Group working as a technical consultant. I studied at the University of Windsor, completing my bachelor's degree in computer science and graduating with a major GPA of 3.7. During my time at the university, I interned for 16 months at IBM. While there, I primarily worked as a front-end developer, where I gained knowledge of how to create efficient and responsive UIs by developing features and workflows for SPSS Statistics, a statistical analysis application. Upon graduating, I worked for a year at Amazon on the operations side.  My main focus was on developing the tools sellers would use to ship their goods to Amazon warehouses, which helped me learn the basics of working with microsystem architecture. I find learning to be a very fun process, which is why I think I enjoyed my time at IBM and Amazon with all of the opportunities they presented to dive deep into technologies I wasn't familiar with. I prioritize personal growth more than anything and am eagerly looking for opportunities to improve my skills as a software developer. Outside of work, I enjoy going for runs, weight lifting, and playing video games. I hope you enjoy reading my profile.

    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: "Implemented a monitoring agent to collect real-time resource usage of nodes in a Linux cluster using, using Bash shell script. The app runs via a crontab daemon on the respective hosts, periodically collecting metrics required by the Jarvis LCA team using command-line utilities such as vmstat and lscpu. The results are then stored in a relational database via PostgreSQL, where they can be queried for analysis. The app is run from a Docker container for ease of deployment and modification."
  - name: "Grep App"
    git_url: "/core_java/grep"
    description: "Created a command-line tool modeled after Grep using Java's regex API. The tool takes in a pattern and writes all lines that match the expression in a given directory to a specified outfile. The app makes use of modern Java 8 features, such as Lambda and Stream APIs to make the processing of the data efficient. The tool utilizes Maven as its build system and is deployed via Docker."
  - name: "JDBC App"
    git_url: "/core_java/jdbc"
    description: "A simple Java app that uses the JDBC API to execute CRUD operations on a PSQL database. The app makes use of DAO and repository design patterns to maintain data integrity. The app had its dependencies managed via Maven and was deployed through Docker."
  - name: "Twitter CRUD App"
    git_url: "/core_java/twitter"
    description: "Created a Java CRUD application that uses Twitter's REST API v2 to create and manage tweets. The user can create tweets, search for tweets, or delete a list of tweets by ID, all from via CLI. The app sends requests to Twitter's API through HTTP requests in the form of JSON messages, authenticated with OAuth. The architecture used follows the MVC design pattern, with unit and integration testing being done through Mockito and JUnit. The build system used was Maven, and deployment was done through Docker."

    description: "Developed a two-dimensional roguelike adventure game in C# and Unity, similar to games such as The Oregon Trail. Following agile practices, I worked as the sole developer for the majority of the project, handling the creation of art assets, and designing and implementing the software architecture. The backend utilizes SQLite as the RDBMS for lightweight storage of player and game data. The game features hand-drawn pixel art, as well as the usage of various post-processing effects to provide an immersive experience."
