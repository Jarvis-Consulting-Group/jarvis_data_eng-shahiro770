summary: Hi, my name is Shahir. I studied at the University of Windsor, where I completed my bachelor's degree in computer science and graduated with a cumulative GPA of 3.3/4.0 and a major GPA of 3.7/4.0. During my time at the university, I interned for 16 months at IBM. While there, I primarily worked as a frontend developer, implementing UI features and workflows on SPSS Statistics, a statistical analysis application. Upon graduating, I worked for a year at Amazon on the operations side. My work was mainly focused on maintaining and updating services related to workflows sellers would use for inbounding their goods to Amazon Fulfillment Centers. I find learning to be a very fun process, which is why I think I enjoyed my time at IBM and Amazon with all of the opportunities they presented to dive deep into technologies I wasn't familiar with. I prioritize personal growth more than anything and am eagerly looking for opportunities to improve my skills as a software developer. If given the chance, I will do everything I can to deliver on any set of expectations. Outside of work, I enjoy going to the gym and playing video games. I hope you enjoy reading my profile.
